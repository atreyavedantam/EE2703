## Instructions to run the codes

Please open the zipped folder and ensure that the .txt files are also in the same working directory as the python .py files.
Then simply run the following terminal commands:
`python3 dataset1.py`,
`python3 dataset2.py`,
`python3 dataset3_1.py`,
`python3 dataset3_2.py`.

The output figures will get automatically generated in the same working directory because of the use of `plt.savefig()`. Please go through the generated plots if necessary. In addition, the documentation has also been attached with the 4 python source files explaining my approach to this assignment. It is a PDF file which I generated by writing a notebook in the Jupyter server and exporting as PDF. Please go through that as well. Thank you.
